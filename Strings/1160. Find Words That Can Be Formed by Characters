class Solution:
    def countCharacters(self, words: List[str], chars: str) -> int:
        chars_counter = Counter(chars)
        return sum(len(word) for word in words if Counter(word) <= chars_counter)




'''
Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.

Aim is to check is a word in words is made up of characters from chars string. And return the sum of length of those words.

example:
Counter("rat") is Counter({'r': 1, 'a': 1, 't': 1}).
The condition Counter("rat") <= Counter("abc") is False because the count of 'r' in "rat" (1) is greater than the count of 'r' in "abc" (0).
